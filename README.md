PyUserInputGen
==============

This project is a fork from [Paul Barton's PyUserInput](https://github.com/SavinaRoja/PyUserInput).

It adds some material for improving genericity if it's about keyboard pattern.
For now, the AZERTY (french) pattern has been added for Mac OSX.
The Windows platform is not changed.

TODO : add an argument to PyKeyboard constructor to set the layout (FR/US)
